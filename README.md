# Book-Search-Engine-MERN-21

## Purpose 
To update the starter code to use Graphql's resolvers and typeDefs, and React's mutations and queries to replace routes.  The app allows its user to Login/SignUp, search books, save books, and delete books. I had issues with graphql in the beginning, but this project forced me to learn and understand what is actually happening behind the scenes of a full stack web application. 

## Built With
- React 
- Graphql
- Node.js 
- Express.js
